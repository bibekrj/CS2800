# Storefront Website Story & Wireframe Submission  
**Assignment Phase:** Project Story + Wireframes  
**Due:** October 24, 2025 11:59 PM

---

## Objective

Before you begin coding your storefront website, you must submit a **concept proposal** that defines the story, purpose, and design direction of your project.  
This phase focuses on **planning, creativity, and communication** — skills essential for front-end developers who design for real clients and audiences.

Your submission will include:

1. A **written story and project narrative** (creative brief).  
2. A **set of annotated wireframes** for all key pages of your site.

## Part 1: The Story — “Who Are You Building For?”

Write a **short narrative** that outlines the context and purpose of your website. The story should feel like a **client pitch** and must include the following components:

### 1. Client Profile
Invent or identify a **fictional or real client** who has commissioned your website.  
Describe:
- Who they are and what they do  
- What products or services they offer  
- Why they need a website and what goals it should achieve  

> Example: *“Luna’s Lattes is a local artisan coffee shop in Dayton, OH that wants to expand online by selling limited-edition coffee beans and branded mugs. They need a clean, modern storefront that matches their cozy, handcrafted aesthetic.”*

---

### 2. Purpose & Goals
- Define the **main purpose** of your site.  
- Is it meant to **sell**, **promote**, **educate**, or **inspire**?  
- Explain what success looks like for the client — and how the user experience supports it.

---

### 3. Target Audience
Describe the intended users:
- Who will visit this site?  
- What are their needs, habits, and motivations?  
- How should the site’s tone, layout, or color scheme appeal to them?

---

### 4. User Story or Journey
Write a **short narrative or step-by-step story** describing how a typical user would interact with your site:
> “A first-time visitor lands on the homepage, browses through featured products, adds two items to their cart, then uses the checkout form to complete a purchase.”


---

### 5. Visual & Design Direction
Summarize the **visual and stylistic personality** of your site:
- What colors, typography, or imagery fit your brand/client?  
- How will you balance aesthetic design with usability and accessibility?  
- Mention at least one design principle you’ll intentionally apply (e.g., Gestalt, contrast, hierarchy, alignment, proximity).

---

## Part 2: The Wireframes — “How Will It Look?”

Create **clear, labeled wireframes** for your main pages:

- `index.html` (storefront / landing page)  
- `product.html` (single product view)  
- `cart.html` (shopping cart)  
- `checkout.html` (form)

Each wireframe must:

- Indicate layout regions (header, hero area, product grid, footer, etc.).  
- Include at least **one interactive element** per page (buttons, links, forms).  
- Use clear annotations or callouts describing **functionality, design intent, or accessibility** decisions.  
- Demonstrate **visual consistency** and **navigational flow** between pages.

---

## Tools & Format

You may use any of the following tools:
- Digital tools (Draw.io, Figma, Balsamiq, Canva, Adobe XD, etc.)  

Your final deliverable must be exported as a **Markdown** containing:
1. The written story section  
2. All annotated wireframes

Name the file as:  
`Lastname_Firstname_Storefront_Story_Wireframes.md`

---

## Submission Instructions

- Upload your Markdown with Wireframe images(png, jpg, etc.) to **GitHub Classroom (Final Project Repository)**.   
- Upload your Markdown with Zipped Images to **Pilot**.

> **Instructor Note:** This deliverable is meant to test your ability to think like a designer before you code like a developer. The stronger your story and wireframes, the easier it will be to translate them into a functional, accessible site later.
